**Since I left F-Droid (and Android/Smartphones) about a year ago, I am looking for a new maintainer to take over. Unfortunately the upstream issue I opened 3 years ago is still not solved in 2018. While Fennec F-Droid is back in the mainline repo and other binary repos do serve Firefox, some might still prefer this updater. So as I said: Maintainers welcome. The main task should be to test the last few merge requests (especially the background update stuff) and release a new version**

## Firefox-Updater

An Android app to install and/or update Firefox for Android on your device, without using the Google Play Store.

Shows the currently installed Firefox version (if available) and allows to query Mozilla's [releases directory site](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/releases/) for the latest Firefox for Android release. It also lets a user start downloading the latest release version.

Currently the app is an activity with a two-button GUI. Checks for and displays the most current available version when the "Check available version"-button is tapped. The "Download Firefox" button starts an intent to download the last version from a URL described in Mozilla's [README.txt](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/releases/latest/README.txt). However, the plan is to move this to an Android service to perform periodical update checks and download/install from within the app itself.

## History

Since Mozilla [shut down their FTP server on 2015-08-05](https://blog.mozilla.org/it/2015/07/27/product-delivery-migration-what-is-changing-when-its-changing-and-the-impacts/), non-playstore updates of Firefox have to be done by third-party apps such as this one.


Mozilla now uses a uniform URL to point to the latest release, see [their README](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/releases/latest/README.txt) for details. The current URL for Android is: https://download.mozilla.org/?product=fennec-latest&os=android&lang=multi

I opened a ticket about non-playstore updates with Mozilla in 2015, as did others:
