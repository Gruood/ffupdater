Depending on your device, you might see multiple options to choose from. Most downloaders will show an icon indicating the progress. Once finished, open the resulting APK file and choose the installer.\n\nThis is a rather clumsy user experience, so any help is certainly welcome!\n\nWARNING!!! If you install any version of Firefox, you do it at your own risk. FFUpdater authors are not responsible for the damage that any Firefox version can make to your device or any data.
